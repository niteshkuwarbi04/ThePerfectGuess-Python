# thePerfectGuess-Python
A program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it.
If the player's guess is higher than the actual number, the program displays "Lower number please".
Similarly when player guesses a lower number, the program displays "Higher number please".
When the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the number of guesses the player used to arrive at the number.
